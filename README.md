# 260StartUp
## Project Idea
Want to choreograph your favorite songs with others? This new website will allow you to look through songs and create your own dances to go along with others! You can also see edits from others and it will save your choreographies. It also keeps track of the number of contributions you make and will let you know when someone else makes an edit on a song!
## Key Features
- Collaboration with others
- Keep track of edits
- Choose from variety of songs
- Seperate editing page, login page, and search songs page
- Lit up star on songs that you contributed to
## How Technology is Used
HTML will be used to create the basic layout of the pages, CSS will style and add glowing star when contribution is made. JavaScript will be used to switch pages with buttons, take inputs from users and save it. The Web Server will help with calls like saving the information that is input and with finding user information when logging in. A login screen will show up first and allow a user to have an account connected to their information, the Database will store username/password pairs and the information associated with the users. WebSocket will be used to send a message to everyone when a user makes and saves an edit and React will deal with routing to different urls based on a user's actions and what they click.
